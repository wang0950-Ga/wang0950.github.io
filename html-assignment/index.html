    <p>I think it is inevitable that people will be surrounded by feeling of depression and hopeless for any unpredictable reason. My solution is trying to recall <em>the most beautiful and warmest moment in my life</em>, and to feel every detail that make me happiness. After I use this to resist a wave of depression, I will dive into a long-term plan, such as, to prepare for important exam, to learn another language, etc. When I can not concentrate anymore, I just do the things I like. For example, play videogame, watch movie and so on. When I feel hungry, I go to cook. When I feel sleepy, I go to sleep. When I am confused about life, I ask myself what I really want in my deep inside. When I can not find the answer but I have to move on, I go to the Bible. </p>

    <P>After Marth 17<sup>th</sup> 2020 , I have done a bunch of things I never thought. I pass the <abbr title="Postgraduate Admission Test is a standardized test that is an admission requirement for all graduate schools in mainland China.">postgraduate examination of China</abbr>. I received an acceptant letter for a master degree from a fancy university in China. I find my job during lockdown. I got a certification of Python3 course. I pass the IELTS test overall 6.5. And now, I am here, Ottawa, try my best to deal with my homework.</P>
