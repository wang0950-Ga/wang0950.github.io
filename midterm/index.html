                a modern
                Japanese martial art,
                descended from <abbr title="one of the old Japanese martial arts, swordsmanship">kenjutsu</abbr> ,
                that
                uses <abbr title="shinai">bamboo swords</abbr>
                as well as protective <abbr title="bōgu">armor</abbr>. Today, it is widely practiced within Japan
                and

                        strike or thrust made onto a datotsu-bui of the opponent's kendo-gu with the shinai making
                        contact at its datotsu-bu, the competitor displaying high spirits, correct posture and followed
                        by zanshin.<br>Zanshin (残心), or continuation of awareness, must be present and shown throughout
                        the execution
                        of the strike and the kendōka must be mentally and physically ready to attack again.
                    </p>
                    <p> In competition, there are usually three referees (審判, shinpan). Each referee holds a red flag
                        and
                        a white flag in opposing hands. To award a point, a referee raises the flag corresponding to the
                        color of the ribbon worn by the scoring competitor. Usually, at least two referees must agree
                        for a point to be awarded. Play is stopped after each point is awarded.

                <P>
                    <img src="images/kids-kendo-1000.jpg" alt=""> achievement in kendo is measured by advancement in
                    grade, rank or level. The kyū (級) and
                    dan (段) grading system, created in 1883, is used to indicate one's proficiency in kendo. The dan
                    levels are from first-dan (初段, sho-dan) to tenth-dan (十段, jū-dan). There are usually six grades
                    below first-dan, known as kyu. The kyu numbering is in reverse order, with first kyu (一級, ikkyū)
                    being the grade immediately below first dan, and sixth kyu (六級, rokkyū) being the lowest grade.
                    There are no visible differences in dress between kendo grades; those below dan-level may dress the
                    same as those above dan-level.
